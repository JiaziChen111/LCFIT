* Note about the operating system.  LCFIT was developed on a Linux
  machine, running gentoo, and ~amd64 flag for emerge.  I have tried
  to make it as platform independent as possible, but there are
  caveats.  (1) I can't imagine it will run on a non-Unix machine
  without an immense amount of work.  (2) Lapack and friends can be
  quirky to deal with, even with automatic intsall programs like
  emerge (or rpm or apt or whatever).  (3) Every server environment
  becomes optimized unconsciously by the administrator, and there are
  likely to be unknown dependencies that will only be weeded out
  through testing.

* Install dependencies.  python, Cheetah, apache, mod_python, scipy,
  numpy, matplotlib, psycopg2, lapack, postgres

* Download LCFIT into a subdirectory of your apache webpages.
  "larry-data/" will hopefully magically appear.  Make sure
  permissions are XXX.

* Edit LcConfig for administrator emails, user directories

** update apache/httpd.conf.  All I have is stuff for permissions and
   htpasswd etc.  Just make sure that the registration page is open to
   the world, even if the other stuff is not.

** update the mod_python config file

	# LCFIT directory
	<Directory /var/www/localhost/htdocs/lcfit>
		SetHandler mod_python
		PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
		PythonDebug On
	</Directory>

* Install a blank database from the schema provided (which contains
  some entries already for things like class names etc) under the
  postgres user "larry".

* Register a test user.  There should be a script based on the daily
  email.  [From the registration page to an email to the administrator
  would be easiest.]

* Create some data from HMD

* Confirm the user for the unit tests exists, run unit tests

* Voila
