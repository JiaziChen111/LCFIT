LCFIT -- Lee Carter FITter

LCFIT is a python program that implements the Lee-Carter mortality
model and forecasting algorithm.  Basically, the Lee-Carter model uses
the Singular Value Decomposition to decompose a matrix of mortality
rates into a single time series ("k_t") showing the overall mortality
trend, a base set of age specific mortality rates ("a_x"), and a vector
("b_x") that describes the amount of mortality change at a give age for
a unit of overall mortality change.  (The input data is usually
structured with each different age interval as a column and each year
as a row.)

This project uses mod_python + apache to serve the pages, postgresql
to store the data, scipy + numpy to do the calculations, and
matplotlib to make graphics.

This code repository also contains some code written in R and Matlab
to perform LCFIT in other contexts.
