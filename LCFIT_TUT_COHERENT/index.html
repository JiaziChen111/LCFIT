  <h1><a name="top">LCFIT Coherent Tutorial</a></h1>

  <p>If you have never used LCFIT for mortality forecasting, you should first
	get familiar with the single population LCFIT interface using 
	<a href="../LCFIT_TUT/index.html">this tutorial</a>.</p>

  <h2><a name="overview"><a href="#top">Overview of LCFIT data entry</a></a></h2>

  <p>We have the same basic input style as with single population, except for a
	few new things:
	<ol>
	  <li>One, there is a box for population counts in addition to the box for mortality rates (two boxes!).

	  <li>Two, there is a field for labels for each subpopulation.

      <li>Three, you have to format all of these inputs in order to distinguish
	between the different subpopulations.  With population and mortality rates,
	you put a blank line between different subpopulations.  With the labels, you
	put a space between the short strings used for each subpopulation.  In the
	example, I use "FIN", "JAP", and "USA" for Finland, Japan, and the USA.

	</ol>
  <p>Here is what a screen looks like before entering any data:</p>

  <p>Here is what a screen looks like AFTER entering any data. It is OK that the
  data seems to wrap around (the newline structure of the data is fine).</p>

  <h2><a name="datamgmt"><a href="#top">Data management</a></a></h2>

  <p>There are sometimes data management issues with coherent datasets.  I keep
  mine in plain text files in my working directory, then load them into the
  clipboard with the Mac OS X command "pbcopy".  See below for an example of
  calling pbcopy on the command line.</p>

  <h2><a name="results"><a href="#top">Examining the results</a></a></h2>

	<p> Find the most recent forecast in the stack of forecasts. Click on
	it. Here is a listing page example:</p>

	<a href="./JPGS/list_w_forecast.jpg">  
	<img class="scrnsht" src="./JPGS/list_w_forecast.jpg" alt="LCFIT List of forecasts" /> </a> 

	<p> You will be presented with something that looks the image below.  There
	are fewer graphs than in the single population LCFIT application, because
	they become much harder to interpret with multiple populations. </p>
	
	<p>The plot on the left is the life expectancy at age zero (e_0) for each
	population (colored), and the average of the populations (black).  The faint
	lines are modeled values; both solid and strong indicates empirical, while
	solid and faint indicates modeled.  The dashed lines are forecasted
	e_0's.</p>

	<p>The plot on the right describes the kt values.  The slightly fainter
	lines are the kt's for the residual values, the strong lines are the kt's
	for the hte main trend.  Dashed indicates forecast values.</p>

	<p>The table contains the main parameters for the time series forecasts (see
	the articles for more information).</p>

	<p>As always, use the Object Dump link to get all the data, including
	intermediate values.</p>
