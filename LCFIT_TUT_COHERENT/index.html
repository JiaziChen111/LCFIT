  <h1><a name="top">LCFIT Coherent Tutorial</a></h1>

	<p>This tutorial will guide the user through an entire "coherent" mortality
	forecasting process using LCFIT. This forecasting method allows the user to
	forecast several populations that are interrelated somehow.  Applications
	include male and female subpopulations in a single country, or multiple
	countries that share social characteristics (our example is using three
	developed nations with long life expectancies -- Japan, Finland, and the
	US.<p>

    <p> Note that if you have never used LCFIT for mortality forecasting, you
	should first get familiar with the single population LCFIT interface using
	<a href="../LCFIT_TUT/index.html">this tutorial</a>.  The basic tutorial
	covers things like logging in and getting useable data from
	the <a href="http://www.mortality.org">Human Mortality Database</a>.</p>

	<p>The tutorial goes as follows: (click to navigate):</p>

  <h2><a name="overview"><a href="#top">Entering data with the coherent method</a></a></h2>

  <p>We have the same basic input style as with single population LCFIT, except
	for a few new things:

	<ol>
	  <li>One, there is a box for population counts in addition to the box for mortality rates (two boxes!).

	  <li>Two, there is a field for labels for each subpopulation.

      <li>Three, you have to format all of these inputs in order to distinguish
	between the different subpopulations.  With population and mortality rates,
	you put a blank line between different subpopulations.  With the labels, you
	put a space between the short strings used for each subpopulation.  In the
	example, I use "FIN", "JAP", and "USA" for Finland, Japan, and the USA.

	</ol>
  <p>Here is what a screen looks like before entering any data:</p>

  <p>Here is what a screen looks like AFTER entering any data. It is OK that the
  data seems to wrap around (the logical structure of the data is fine).</p>

  <h2><a name="datamgmt"><a href="#top">Managing complex coherent data.</a></a></h2>

  <p>There are sometimes data management issues with coherent datasets.  I keep
  mine in plain text files in my working directory, then load them into the
  clipboard with the Mac OS X command "pbcopy".  Other people use Excel.  See
  below for an example of calling pbcopy on the command line.</p>

  <h2><a name="results"><a href="#top">Examining coherent forecast results</a></a></h2>

	<p> Find the most recent forecast in the stack of forecasts. Click on
	it. Here is a listing page example:</p>

	<a href="./JPGS/list_w_forecast.jpg">  
	<img class="scrnsht" src="./JPGS/list_w_forecast.jpg" alt="LCFIT List of forecasts" /> </a> 

	<p> You will be presented with something that looks the image below.  There
	are fewer graphs than in the single population LCFIT application, because
	they become much harder to interpret with multiple populations. </p>
	
	<p>The plot on the left is the life expectancy at age zero (e_0) for each
	population (colored), and the average of the populations (black).  The faint
	lines are modeled values; both solid and strong indicates empirical, while
	solid and faint indicates modeled.  The dashed lines are forecasted
	e_0's.</p>

	<p>The plot on the right describes the kt values.  The slightly fainter
	lines are the kt's for the residual values, the strong lines are the kt's
	for the hte main trend.  Dashed indicates forecast values.</p>

	<p>The table contains the main parameters for the time series forecasts (see
	the articles for more information).</p>

	<p>As always, use the Object Dump link to get all the data, including
	intermediate values.</p>
